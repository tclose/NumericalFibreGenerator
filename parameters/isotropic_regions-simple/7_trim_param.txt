# --- The parameters used to trim strands to fit sphere. ---
#
# Please enter parameter names on separate lines (with no preceding space) followed by a single space 
# and then its value. Lines without recognised parameter names in this format will be ignored. 
#
# E.g. 
# name 0.0 		(Remember, NO preceding space and only ONE space between name and value!)
# 
#
# NB: The generated phantom is scale invariant.  All parameters representing spatial quantities are only 
# relative to one another and therefore defined in abstract units (U).
#

new_sphere_r 1.0		# (U) Defines the radius outside which all strands are trimmed.

length_reject_threshold	0.05	# (U) Defines the length threshold, below which any section of 
				# trimmed strand is rejected.
