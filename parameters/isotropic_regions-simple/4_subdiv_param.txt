# --- The parameter (yes, very simple only one!) used to subdivide strands into thinner strands. ---
#
# Please enter parameter names on separate lines (with no preceding space) followed by a single space
# and then its value. Lines without recognised parameter names in this format will be ignored. 
#
# E.g. 
# name 0.0 		(Remember, NO preceding space and only ONE space between name and value!)
# 
#
# NB: The generated phantom is scale invariant.  All parameters representing spatial quantities are only
# relative to one another and therefore defined in abstract units (U).
#

strand_r_final 0.03	# (U) Defines the radius of the subdivided strands
