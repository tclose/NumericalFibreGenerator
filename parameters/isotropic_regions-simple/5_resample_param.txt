# --- The parameters used to resample strands to control point intervals of equal length ---
#
# Please enter parameter names on separate lines (with no preceding space) followed by a single space
# and then its value. Lines without recognised parameter names in this format will be ignored. 
#
# E.g. 
# name 0.0 		(Remember, NO preceding space and only ONE space between name and value!)
# 
#
# NB: The generated phantom is scale invariant.  All parameters representing spatial quantities are only
# relative to one another and therefore defined in abstract units (U).
#

resample_length 0.02			# (U) Defines the length of the new inter control-point intervals

double_back_angle_threshold 150	# (degrees) The angle between successive segments above which 
							# the second segment is considered to have doubled back on itself.

forward_angle_threshold 80	# (degrees) The angle between successive segments above which 
							# the second segment is considered to have doubled back on itself.
