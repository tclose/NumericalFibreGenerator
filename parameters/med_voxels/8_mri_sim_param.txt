# --- The parameters used to simulate the DW-MR images emanating from the strands. ---
#
# Please enter parameter names on separate lines (with no preceding space) followed by a single space
# and then its value. Lines without recognised parameter names in this format will be ignored. 
#
# E.g. 
# name 0.0 		(Remember, NO preceding space and only ONE space between name and value!)
# 
#
# NB: The generated phantom is scale invariant.  All parameters representing spatial quantities are only
# relative to one another and therefore defined in abstract units (U).
#

fa 0.8					# (dimensionless) The fractional anisotropy of the diffusion model
						# used at each sub-voxel grid element.

diffusivity 0.0009			# (mm^2/s) The simulated diffusivity of liquid in the tissue   

num_voxels 10				# (dimensionless) Defines the field of view. The number of voxels 
						# along each dimension of the image (The field of view is a
						 cube)
voxel_size 0.15				# (U) The size of each dimension of the voxel (the voxels are cubes)

subvoxel_size 0.005			# (U) The size of each dimension of the subvoxel grid elements (the 
						# grid elements are cubes). NB: Will be rounded down to the
						# nearest whole divisor of the voxel size.	

sphere_r 1.0				# For use in calculating the filling fraction of the final strand 
						# configuration (see the output file '{strand_directory}/stats/stats.txt' for this value)

save_subvoxels 0			# Specifies that the subvoxel orientations should be saved (to a file 
						# './subvoxels/subvoxels.dat') for debugging purposes.  These
						# orientations can then be displayed with the
						# 'display_subvoxels' matlab script.  Note that these files will
						#  be quite large for high resolution images (300 x 300 x 300 
						# subvoxels ~ 600MB) so it is probably not recommended for a 
						# resolution over 200 x 200 x 200 subvoxels.	
						
save_ext_segment_stats 0		# Specifies that extended statistics on a segment-by-segment basis should be saved ( into
						# './stats/') for debugging purposes.  

save_ext_fill_radial_stats 0		# Specifies that extended statistics radial distance the filling occurs should be saved ( into
						# './stats/') for debugging purposes (can take a large amount of space for fine subvoxel grids).  


output_format analyze		# The output format in which the images will be saved in
